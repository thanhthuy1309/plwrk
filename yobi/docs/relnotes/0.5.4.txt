Yobi v0.5.4 Release Notes
=========================

Backward compatibility notes
----------------------------

It may break that push to some git repositories which have a merge-repository
because of missing object, with an following error:

    To http://yobi/you/repo1
    ! [remote rejected] master -> master (object 97c4c34b825debd0fe76bf5d850d0891d4a93bba missing)
    error: failed to push some refs to 'http://yobi/you/repo1'

Fortunately, the repositories can be recovered by copying git objects from the
object directory of the merge-repository. For an example in Linux:

    cd yobi
    cp repos/git-merging/you/repo1.git/.git/objects/* \
        repos/git/you/repo1.git/objects -R
