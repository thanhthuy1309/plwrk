Yobi v0.7.0 Release Notes
=========================

Updates since v0.6.4
--------------------

New Features

* Private Site
    * Yobi requires users to authenticate themselves to access any
      page if application.allowsAnonymousAccess is false. (4a81d87)
    * Every link to outside of the Yobi site has 'rel=noreferrer' attribute so
      that the client, which supports HTML5, does not provide the referrer for
      the linked site, if application.noreferrer is true. (4d4f0a9, 531c212)

Enhancements

* In notification emails, the addresses of users are not hidden if
  application.notification.bymail.hideAddress is false. (3ffd70f)
* A text drag-and-copied from the rendered diff contains filenames to be
  a complete unified context diff. (bdc74a6)
* In closed issue list, each issue shows the duedate instead of the remaining
  days. (046164f)
* Project list provides not only public projects but also protected or private
  projects which the user has been joined in. (2e70827)
* Notification emails have a meaningful message-id so that the other emails can
  refer them by using References header. It helps some MUAs to bind emails into
  a thread. (87694d4)
* Notification emails for a comment on source code can contain the code.
  (66781bc)
* When authentication with Git client is failed, Yobi tells the reason.

  improve usability for choosing many labels. (b544cd6)

  used for merging. (e20053f)
